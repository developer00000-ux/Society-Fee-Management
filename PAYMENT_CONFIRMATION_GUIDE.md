# Payment Confirmation System Guide

## Overview

The payment confirmation system has been implemented to ensure proper tracking and verification of payments in the society management application. This system automatically confirms digital payments while requiring manual confirmation for cash and payment request entries.

## 🎯 **Key Features**

### **Automatic Confirmation**
- **UPI Payments**: Automatically confirmed (digital proof available)
- **Card Payments**: Automatically confirmed (digital proof available)
- **Bank Transfer**: Automatically confirmed (digital proof available)

### **Manual Confirmation Required**
- **Cash Payments**: Require manual confirmation by admin/block manager
- **Request Payment**: Require manual confirmation after payment is made

## 🔧 **Database Changes**

### **New Fields Added to `fee_entries` Table**
```sql
-- Payment confirmation status
payment_confirmed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false

-- Who confirmed the payment
payment_confirmed_by UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id)

-- When the payment was confirmed
payment_confirmed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE

-- Who created the entry
created_by UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id)
```

### **Automatic Confirmation Trigger**
```sql
-- Auto-confirms non-cash/non-request payments
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auto_confirm_payment()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF NEW.payment_type NOT IN ('Cash', 'Request Payment') THEN
        NEW.payment_confirmed = true;
        NEW.payment_confirmed_at = NOW();
        NEW.payment_confirmed_by = NEW.created_by;
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
